# Classification Metrics

Classfication metrics measure and show the efficiency of a machine learning model/algorithm with respect to its data.

This example trains and predicts the following algorithms or machine learning models:
- Naive Bayes
- Bagging Classifier
- Random Forest Classfier
- AdaBoostClassifier
- Support Vector Machine

and calculates the following classification metrics:
- accuracy_score
- precision_score
- recall_score
- f1_score
- fbeta_score
